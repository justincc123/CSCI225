        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p> Hello my name is Justin Coleman. I am a fourth year here at
            USCA majoring in Computer Science with Applied Gaming. I enjoy playing
            video games, car meets, and spending time with family. My biggest hobby right now
            is going to the gym, in the last year and a half I have lost 120 pounds.
            Most of my experience with coding is C++, I have created a few demo games and
            one fully functioning RNG game.

            <li>RNG Game
                <p>     For this project we created an open world wizard game. With a group of 4 working the game was completed in six weeks.
                    The game was created using java in Eclipse. The game is a text based RPG where the player can explore the world, fight enemies, and level up their character.
                    The game featured many side quests and a main quest. There was a currency based shop where the player could buy weapons, armor, and potions. Using the save 
                    feature players could take a break and return at any moment. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Budget Tracker
                <p>     For this project I used VB.NET in Microsoft Visual Studio. The tracker included multiple features the most outstanding one 
                    being a future teller. The tracker was able to hold any information the user inputted and display it in a readable format. 
                    The user could input their income and expenses so the tracker could display them or even calculate their future spendings. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Plinko Ball
                <p>     For this project I used C++ in Microsoft Visual Studio. Over the course of 2 weeks I created a program that would
                    mimic the famous gambling game Plinko. The program would drop a ball from the top of the board and wait for it to drop.
                    The program included multiple features such as changing the price of the Plinko or the number of Plinkos dropped.</p>
            </li>
            <li>3D Poker Animation
                <p>     For this project I created a short animation that showed a game of poker being played. I used C++ in Microsoft Visual Studio.
                    This was for a final project and used many different properties to complete. The most important property was light. The project focused on 
                    light reflection when being moved. The reflection was unique for each texture.</p>
            </li>
            <li>8 Ball Game
                <p>     For this project I used C++ in Microsoft Visual Studio. I created a fully functioning pool game. This program 
                    has heavy involvment of physics. The most difficult part was mimicing the table fabric slowing the ball and affecting 
                    how the balls bounced off the wall or each other.</p>

            <li> Air Hockey Game

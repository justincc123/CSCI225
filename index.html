        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p> Hello my name is Justin Coleman. I am a fourth year here at
            USCA majoring in Computer Science with Applied Gaming. I enjoy playing
            video games, car meets, and spending time with family. My biggest hobby right now
            is going to the gym, in the last year and a half I have lost 120 pounds.
            Most of my experience with coding is C++, I have created a few demo games and
            one fully functioning RNG game.
